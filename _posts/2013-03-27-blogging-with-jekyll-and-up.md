## Blogging with Jekyll

I have been very lazy to maintain a blog. So again, I'm just trying to test what happens if I 
use jekyll, markdown and github to blog.

I'm using the fantastic [up](https://github.com/caarlos0/up) theme by github user caarlos0.

So.. don't expect me to update this very often. I will do it when I feel like it.
