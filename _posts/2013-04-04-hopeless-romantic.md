I used to be a hopeless romantic, I still like the idea of meeting your other half and being happy ever after.  But I don't think it's possible. 

There's several problems with that idea:

* Society trains and rewards an egoist behaviour.
* They make us think it should be easy.
* We change with time.

Everything's possible, but there are costs and work is needed. 

We should stop thinking as individuals, families for instance should work as a unit, taking everyone into account. Tolerance is very important.
Eastern culture used to be that way, the thing is that it is much harder than what Western culture says.

There's a lot we need to learn. That's another thing, we should not only be open to learning but actively seek knowledge.
